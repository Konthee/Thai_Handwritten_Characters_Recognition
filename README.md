## Introduction

  The Super AI Engineer 2023 (East): Image Processing Challenge (Thai Handwritten Characters Recognition) is a competition for participants to develop strategies for Characters Recognition from Thai Handwritten dataset. In this notebook, I used state of the art from [Timm](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models) such as vit_large_clip, convnext_clip and eva_large
  
```Q: Is this the code I used to get Rank 2 on private scoreboard?```

```A: No, That high score is obtain by Ensemble Method of five models!```

The competition dataset is not publicly available, so participants must provide their own dataset. This notebook is intended to be a resource and inspiration for other participants in the competition.


## Outcome
- **Ranked üéñÔ∏è#2 amongs 53 teams** participating the

- **Scored 0.97735** (eqaul scored rank 1) in private leaderboard
